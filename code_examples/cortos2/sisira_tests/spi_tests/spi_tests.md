# SPI Functionality Test

## Test Program Overview

The test program is designed to verify the functionality of the SPI master interface in the SoC. The primary goal is to validate the SPI configuration, read/write operations, and ensure that the correct values are transferred via the SPI master interface.


### Key Components of the Test Program

1. **SPI Configuration**:
   - The configuration register is written with a value to set the transfer length (16-bits) and clock divide factor (clk/8).
   
2. **Data Transfer**:
   - Data is written to the SPI data registers (DATA0 for low byte, DATA1 for high byte).
   - A command is written to the status register to initiate the transfer.
   
3. **Verification Logic**:
   - The written data is read back from the SPI data registers and compared to ensure that the transfer was successful.
   - The configuration register is also read back to verify that the SPI configuration matches the written value.

4. **Diagnostic Methodology**:
   - Debug prints are included in the main program to track the status of the SPI configuration and data transfers.
   - All results are compared, and the success or failure of the operations is printed.

## Test Assumptions

The assumptions made during testing are as follows:

1. The SPI configuration register correctly sets the transfer length and clock division factor.
2. The data written to the SPI data registers is transferred correctly to the external SPI device (even though in this test, no external device is connected).
3. The SPI master interface behaves correctly when configured for 16-bit transfers and a clock divide factor of clk/8.

## Observed Behavior

The following observations were made during testing:

1. **SPI Configuration**:
   - The configuration register was written with the value 0x38, which sets the transfer length to 16 bits and the clock division to clk/8.
   - The configuration register read-back matched the written value, confirming correct configuration.

2. **Data Transfer**:
   - Data 0x1234 was written to the DATA0 and DATA1 registers, corresponding to the low and high bytes of the 16-bit data.
   - The data was successfully read back from the DATA0 and DATA1 registers, and the written data matched the read data, confirming correct data transfer.

3. **No External SPI Device**:
   - Since the SPI lines are not connected in the current Vivado design, no external SPI transfers were performed. The test solely validated the internal register behavior.

## Potential Explanations

The observations are consistent with the expected behavior for internal register transfers. Since no external SPI device was connected, the test was limited to validating the internal SPI register interface.

## Test Methodology Considerations

We considered the following during our testing methodology:

1. **Internal Testing**:
   - Since no external SPI device was connected, this test only validated the internal SPI master interfaceâ€™s ability to read/write to the registers and verify the configuration.

2. **Diagnostic messages were used to track the results of the SPI read/write operations and configuration**
   - These messages help confirm the values being written to the SPI registers and the results read back from them, allowing you to verify the expected behavior step by step.
    
## Questions for Clarification

1. **SPI Transfer Validity**: 
   - In the current Vivado design, the SPI lines are **Not Connected (N/C)** in the schematic. As such, **no external SPI transfers** were performed. The test solely validates internal register behavior. Is this the expected and correct test approach, or should the SPI lines be connected for a more comprehensive test?
